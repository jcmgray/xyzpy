    "\n",
    "Running a function for many different parameters theoretically allows perfect parallelization since each run is independent. ``xyzpy`` can automatically handle this in a number of different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supply ``parallel=True`` when calling ``Runner.run_combos(...)`` or ``Harvester.harvest_combos(...)`` etc. This spawns a ``ProcessExecutorPool`` with the same number of workers as logical cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Supply ``num_workers=...`` instead to explicitly control how any workers are used. Since for many numeric codes threading is controlled by the environement variable ``$OMP_NUM_THREADS`` you generally want the product of this and ``num_workers`` to be equal to the number of cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Supply ``executor=...`` to use any custom parallel pool-executor like object (e.g. a ``dask.distributed`` client or ``mpi4py`` pool) which has a ``submit``/``apply_async`` method, and yields futures with  a ``result``/``get`` method. More specifically, this covers pools with an API matching either ``concurrent.futures`` or an ``ipyparallel`` view. Pools from ``multiprocessing.pool`` are also explicitly handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use a {class}`~xyzpy.Crop` to write combos to disk, which can then be 'grown' persistently by any computers with access to the filesystem, such as distributed cluster - see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three options can be used on any of the various functions derived from {func}`~xyzpy.combo_runner`:\n"
